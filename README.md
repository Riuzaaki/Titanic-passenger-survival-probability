Source of Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data

Algorithms used:
->Logistic Regression
->Gradient Descent

We use the inbuilt Logistic Regression package from sklearn library to train our model and then we compare the score between gradient descent model and the inbuilt library.
We can see that our gradient descent is slightly better than sklearn.
